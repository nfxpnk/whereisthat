# Where is That?

**Where is That?** is an open-source Windows application that aims to be a modern replacement for the discontinued **Where Is It?** disk cataloging software.

It allows you to catalog, search, and manage the contents of your disks, folders, and external storage devices — all without needing them to be connected. This project is fully free to use for any purpose, with no guarantees or warranties.

## Project Goals

- Create a free and open-source alternative to "Where Is It?"
- Allow users to organize and search through large collections of offline media
- Support modern Windows systems with a clean, intuitive interface
- Encourage community contributions and improvements

## Why This Project?

I started this project because I missed the features and convenience of **Where Is It?**, which is no longer maintained. I’m not experienced with C# or desktop application development, but I’m learning and building this as an open, community-driven effort.
